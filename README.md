1) Difference between var, let, and const:
      * var is function-scoped and re-declare and reassign allowed.
      * let is block-scoped,it's re-declare not-allowed but reassign allowed.
      * const is block-scoped and it's re-declare and reassign not-allowed.

2) Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter():
      * map() is new array return with same length and modified values.
      * forEach() is loop through each item and execute a function.
      * filter() is new array return but only matching elements.

3) Arrow functions in ES6:
      * Arrow functions are a shorter and cleaner way to write functions, introduced in ES6.
        They use the => (fat arrow) syntax instead of the traditional function keyword.

4) Destructuring assignment in ES6:
       * Destructuring assignment is a feature in ES6 that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into separate variables in a very concise way.

5) Template literals in ES6:
       * Template literals are a new way to work with strings in ES6. They are written using    backticks () instead of quotes (' or ").
       String Interpolation – Insert variables and expressions directly inside a string using ${}.
       Multi-line Strings – Write strings across multiple lines without \n.
       Embedded Expressions – Use any JavaScript expression inside ${}.
